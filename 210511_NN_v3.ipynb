    "# Titanic dataset Neural Network \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this work is to apply a basic neural network (NN) to the Titanic dataset that is part of the popular Kaggle machine learning competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/). This dataset consists of a set of two separate csv files 'train' and 'test' that contain 891 and 418 instances of 11 independent variables respectively. These variables describe properties about passengers on that fateful and iconic voyage across the Atlantic. In addition to the 11 independent variables, the train file contains a dependent variable 'Survived' that refers to whether a passenger on the titanic voyage survived (denoted by a 1) or not (denoted by a 0). The test file does not contain the dependent variable 'survived'. Each instance for both files represents a single passenger on the ship. The purpose of this exercise is to develop and train a machine learning model on the 'train' data, and then use this model (a Neural Network in this case) to predict whether the passengers described by the 'test' data 'survive' or not. \n",
    "This is then submitted to the Kaggle website for assessment. "

This is ultimately a process where for each of these two independent variables, a new varialbe is created for each category within either Embarked or Title. For example, for Embarked, there are three categories, C, Q, and S. So now there will be three new independent variables, Embarked_C, Embarked_Q, and Embarked_S, and the original Embarked is removed. Now each new variable is a list of 1's and 0's (hense binarized), and any instance for which a passenger belonged to this category of Embarked receives a 1. Otherwise it is gets a 0. This more numerical representation of the same data is compatible with a Neural Network."
